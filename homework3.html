        <h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>

        <p>
            For Homework 3, I posted 4 JPG images total on this single page (homework3.html): 
            a shallow depth of field photo, a deep depth of field photo, a Photoshop blur version,
            and the original image used for the blur comparison. All images are under 2 MB and saved 
            in the <b>images</b> folder. 
        </p>

        <h2>1 & 2: In-camara shallow vs. deep depth of field</h2>

                Settings: f/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 400. Subject is sharp and background is blurred.

                    <p>
                        I used Filter &gt; Blur Gallery &gt; Field Bluer to blur the background while keeping the subject sharp.

        <h2>Reflection (about 250 words)</h2>
        <p>
            When I was taking the photographs I wanted my subject to have all the attention, although I think that my subject should have been bigger. Even so, I feel that I took a photograph that allowed me to work with it. When taking photographs with shallow and deep depth of field I have to consider some factors, for example aperture and f/stops, which was a bit complicated for me when I was taking the photos. There are some steps you have to follow to get the result you expect, and many times I often forgot to adjust the ISO. Before learning the difference between these two DoF, I thought that natural light was enough, but it is not and I have to adjust the composition to add more light. Creating artificial DoF was a bit fun and I think it was the easiest part for me. I was able to learn how to give more focus and attention to my subject with a blurred background. In Camera Raw adjustments I add a bit of light, which led me to adjust the shadows, highlights and the contrast without losing details from the original photo. After adjusting these details, the photograph still didn’t have the look I was looking for, which made me think that I should have taken the photo with a different composition from the beginning. So I remembered that the histogram could help finish adjusting the image. I adjusted the shallow and highlights a bit more, trying to give the subject more brightness and emphasis, which was what I was looking for. I feel that I got a good result and it was close to how I had imagined it would look
