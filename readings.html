        <h1>Reading 1</h1>

            The text Plato's cave by Susan Sontag reflects the power of photography and how taking pictures can affect our perspective on how we see and analyze our surroundings. Sontag says that taking pictures is not a neutral action even when everything we do or around us can be photographed. When we take pictures we are taking over what we are capturing, we take over moments, people and places turning them into a saved and shared memory. From my own experience, for some time I have used photography as a tool for memory, to always be able to remember moments that I feel that in a few years I will forget and also to express my ideas. This reading made me confirm what I already suspected, on many occasions taking photographs becomes much more important than being present and enjoying the now. As a person who loves to capture moments, this made me remember moments when I saw the world through a camera and not through my own eyes. After this, I felt that in many moments photography has been able to cause distances when we are only observing and recording instead of participating. Sontag also says that photos captured in moments of vulnerability or pain cause a certain type of awareness in people but at the same time it results in the loss of emotional impact making people look numb. I feel that this is widely seen and common today when on social networks we see many images of crises around the world. Knowing that I will be working with different projects in which I will be using different types of tools and means makes me feel analytical and that with the help of Sontag's ideas I will be able to see this whole process as a body which I myself will build. Each image created by me will be a journey and a reflection of how I see the world at different times. As a person who likes to create images and graphics, I think this reading made me think deeply about the responsibility that all this entails. Not only to be committed to what I am creating, but also to the fact that photographs are not only visual objects, images are something appreciated that not only transmits ideas, but also values and meanings. All images are not only formed with a camera, they are also formed by what it includes, what we decide to leave out and what we focus on. Everything always carries a meaning or an intention even when we are not aware of it. I know that it is an illusion built by ideas and meanings that can powerfully show the world in which we live today, a world full of technology, constant changes in which we are involved and in the consumption of images that sometimes touch every fiber of our hearts. As a teenager on many occasions I feel the need to capture the world to feel it real, to feel that I am living it and that I am witnessing many incredible things because seeing it with my eyes does not feel enough but Sontag makes me understand that seeing it is not the same as understanding it. To understand you need more than seeing it, you need reflection, time and context but I feel that we ourselves can have the ability to capture not only the focus, but also the context and its meaning if we emphasize in showing the objective of the image. As a media maker, my goal is not only to capture what I see, my goal is that when seeing my creation a disturbingly good space is created in the mind of each person who sees it, that they feel encouraged and passionate to take the time to think and deeply analyze the world around them up close. I want my work to convey the emotion that I feel when capturing. If photographs are able to keep memories and meanings, I want my photographs to be able to unite hearts and minds just by seeing a creation.
