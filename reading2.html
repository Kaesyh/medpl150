            Polly Hudson's article made me think about the power that AI has to interfere with the way we see the world today through a screen. Artificial intelligence is a powerful machine that distorts the reality of many people. At the beginning of the article she starts talking about the two types of images that we constantly see on social media. One is: images of news, politics, protests and things that really happen. The second is AI content which she calls "AI slop" where we see drawings of animals dressed as humans, weird or silly images and things that at first glance seem to be real. The dangerous part is how easily people can be tricked, especially children, some of whom do not know how to differentiate truth and the lies that are shown on social media. We believe that we are able to differentiate these two types of images easily but when the content looks a little unreal some people believe it because they receive it from people they trust or apps like whatsapp. This shows the ability of AI to seize people's beliefs and feelings. It is a creation that influences people to share things online easily without first checking that it is real, which spreads false information without realizing it. Hudson also says that the content generated by AI over time will affect us in every way and I agree that it will begin to take jobs away from some people. Nowadays seeing so many AI images makes social media unserious, from videos of silly cats living like humans to fake news make me stop taking the platform seriously. This begins to affect our minds by confusing us and making us constantly question what is real and what is not and also it violates physical and moral laws. Social media makes this problem more bigger by showing the same type of content giving to the creator the opportunity to make money when people share those unreal stuff. Even people who know the internet perfectly can get filled in because these images look so real. She explains that entertainment and propaganda images make it more difficult to focus on what really matters, making many people numb to serious news on social media. What stood out to me is how AI is used to push political ideas. What made me realize that this type of content isn't just weird, it could shape how people think about society and politics without them even noticing. After reading this article I feel more aware of the content I see every day. For us it is easy to open an app and start scrolling through pictures and videos but now I am more aware that not everything is real and that some images or videos are made to push ideas and emotions. This article helps us remember that we have to be careful because our eyes believe what they see and begin to think more critically about what AI is causing in the online world.
