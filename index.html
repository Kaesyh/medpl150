            From a very young age, I have loved the feeling of doing something meaningful for others. The sense of pride and satisfaction that comes from realizing im capable of creating and sharing with others has become a part of my life, and I would not trade it for anything. 
Im passionate about seeing a meaningful final result so I can remember a moment, joke or person. Creativity allows me to connect memories, experiences and emotions.
