        <h1>Homework 2: Reflection on Photography and Photoshop</h1>

        <p>
            When I was taking the photographs, these two elements were what caught my attention and made me believe that there could be a good result and for me, it was. I chose these two images because they are the ones that stand out the most and attract attention. In the first image, something that I liked a lot is how the red color stands out and how something that we see everywhere can look interesting in a photograph, I feel that the color has a lot to do with it since the red stands out a lot against the yellow wall, creating a contrast that makes the subject look very remarkable. Although I liked the size of the original photo, cropping it a little helped make it look much better and that created more focus on the subject. I also feel that giving it warm light helped create a calm atmosphere. I chose the second image because it gave me a feeling of sharpness and order. I gave a little contrast to the letters by reducing some light, which gave it that interesting touch that I like to see in the photographs. I think I would have liked to take the photo without the wall on the left being visible, but even so I feel that the contrast helped give potential to the image. I feel that both images have the potential to create visual contrast and interest. By cropping the photographs to give more focus and impact to the subject and emphasizing on shape, light and contrast I aimed to make these images that are visually engaging while maintaining their originality in a certain way keeping them easy to understand.
